## Abstract

This TIP introduces a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data as opposed to just bytestrings into TRON protocol to solve the problem that hashing structured data is non-trivial and errors result in loss of the security properties of the system, etc.

The encoding function, hashing algorithm and signing algorithm is identical to [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712). There are some differences in details. It includes a

- `address`: need to remove TRON unique prefixe(`0x41`) and encoded as `uint160`
- `trcToken`: should be treated as _atomic type_ and encoded as `uint256`
- `chainId`: use `block.chainid & 0xffffffff` instead

## Motivation

This TIP aims to improve the usability of off-chain message signing for use on-chain. We are seeing growing adoption of off-chain message signing as it saves transaction fees and reduces the number of transactions on the blockchain. Currently signed messages are an opaque hex string displayed to the user with little context about the items that make up the message. 

A signature scheme consists of hashing algorithm and a signing algorithm. A good hashing algorithm should satisfy security properties such as determinism, second pre-image resistance and collision resistance. Otherwise, it may cause security problems or replay problems, etc. This standard aims to solve these problems.

## Specifications

For the structured data 𝕊, they are encoded to bytestrings suitable for hashing and signing as follows:

- `encode(domainSeparator : 𝔹²⁵⁶, message : 𝕊) = "\x19\x01" ‖ domainSeparator ‖ hashStruct(message)` where `domainSeparator` and `hashStruct(message)` are defined below.

The encoding is compliant with [TIP-191](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/issues/442) and it\`s totaly compatible with `EIP-712`. The 'version byte' is fixed to `0x01`, the `version specific data` is the 32-byte domain separator `domainSeparator` and the `data to sign` is the 32-byte `hashStruct(message)`.


### Definition of typed structured data `𝕊`

Definitions for all types are identical to `EIP-712`.

### Definition of `hashStruct`

The `hashStruct` function is defined as

- `hashStruct(s : 𝕊) = keccak256(typeHash ‖ encodeData(s))` where `typeHash = keccak256(encodeType(typeOf(s)))`

It's totaly compatible with `EIP-712`.

### Definition of `encodeType`

The type of a struct is encoded as `name ‖ "(" ‖ member₁ ‖ "," ‖ member₂ ‖ "," ‖ … ‖ memberₙ ")"` where each member is written as `type ‖ " " ‖ name`.

It's totaly compatible with `EIP-712`.

For `trcToken`, it should be treated as _atomic type_. 

```Solidity
struct AssetTransfer {
    address from;
    address to;
    trcToken id;
    uint256 amount;
    uint8 v;
    bytes32 r;
    bytes32 s;
}
```

For example, the above `AssetTransfer` struct is encoded as `AssetTransfer(address from,address to,trcToken id,uint256 amount,uint8 v,bytes32 r,bytes32 s)`.

### Definition of `encodeData`

The encoding of a struct instance is `enc(value₁) ‖ enc(value₂) ‖ … ‖ enc(valueₙ)`, i.e. the concatenation of the encoded member values in the order that they appear in the type. Each encoded member value is exactly 32-byte long.

It's totaly compatible with `EIP-712`.

The only difference between TRON address and Ethereum address is that TRON address starts with a byte prefix `0x41` and uses `base58` encoding, so prefix needs to be removed when the address type is processed.

### Definition of `domainSeparator`

```
domainSeparator = hashStruct(tip712Domain)
```

where the type of `tip712Domain` is identical to `EIP712Domain` struct defined in `EIP-712`. It also contains one or more of the below fields.

- `string name` the user readable name of signing domain.
- `string version` the current major version of the signing domain. Signatures from different versions are not compatible.
- `uint256 chainId` the chain id. The user-agent should refuse signing if it does not match the currently active chain.
- `address verifyingContract` the address of the contract that will verify the signature. The user-agent may do contract specific phishing prevention.
- `bytes32 salt` an disambiguating salt for the protocol. This can be used as a domain separator of last resort.

The only difference is that we define the `chainId` data used in the `domainSeparator` to be equal to `block.chainid & 0xffffffff`. In other words, the `chainId` data used in the `domainSeparator` only take the higher four bytes of `block.chainId`.

The formula for calculating the `chainid` in `domainSeparator` is as follows:

```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ChainIdExample {

    // after solidity_v0.8.0
    function getChainId() public view returns(bytes32,uint256) {
        uint256 chainId = block.chainid & 0xffffffff;
        return (bytes32(chainId), chainId);
    }

    // before solidity_v0.8.0
    function getChainIdAssembly() public view returns(bytes32,uint256) {
        uint256 chainId;
        assembly {
            chainId := and(chainid(), 0xffffffff)
        }
        return (bytes32(chainId), chainId);
    }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

The FullNode gRPC calls and `SomeStruct.typeHash` parameter are currently undefined. Defining them should not affect the behaviour of existing DApps.

The Solidity expression `keccak256(someInstance)` for an instance `someInstance` of a struct type `SomeStruct` is valid syntax. It currently evaluates to the `keccak256` hash of the memory address of the instance. This behaviour should be considered dangerous. In some scenarios it will appear to work correctly but in others it will fail determinism and/or injectiveness. DApps that depend on the current behaviour should be considered dangerously broken.
