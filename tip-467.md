# Simple Summary
This TIP aims to establish a more flexible stake model, called Stake 2.0, Stake 2.0 can improve the utilization of network resources, and at the same time enhance the stability of the TRON stake system.


# Motivation
At present, by staking TRX on the TRON network, you can obtain voting rights called TRON Power, as well as bandwidth or energy as resources. The users need to choose whether to obtain whether energy or bandwidth during the stake operation. The obtained resources can also be delegated to other addresses only if they are specified when staking. Once the staking is completed, it is not allowed to unstake within 3 days. Then, the users can perform the unstake operation and immediately obtain the staked TRX.

The delegating of resources under the current stake mechanism is hardly flexible, resulting in low resource utilization and complicated user operations. The stake and delegating operation are bound together at present. If you want to alter your resource delegating object, you need to perform unstaking first, then make another staking and designate a new delegating object. Additionally, the unstake operation must wait for 3 days after staking, which means that the resources obtained cannot be re-delegated to others within 3 days. If the user has already voted before unstaking, the unstake operation will also result in the automatic cancellation of the vote. Hence, all these rules greatly reduce the efficiency of resource allocation and incur extremely complicated user operations to stake and delegate at will.

Since the TVM does not support stake, vote, or delegate commands, the developers are not able to implement related operations in a smart contract, which limits the applications involved staking and delegating, like tokenization and decentralized resource exchange. In addition, the principal will arrive immediately after the stake is released, when the TRX market fluctuates violently, a large number of staking or unstaking operations will be triggered, which will also have a certain impact on the overall stake model.

Therefore, we need a new stake mechanism to solve these problems, separate low-frequency staking operations and high-frequency resource delegating operations, support resource re-delegating without unstaking, and improve resource utilization. Add stake, delegate, vote, and related commands should be added in the TVM, meanwhile, the new mechanism should implement the delayed arrival of unstaking TRX, improve the stability of the stake model under extreme market conditions, and help network participants to form more stable expectations for the total circulation of the entire network.

## Specifications
Based on the description above, a newly designed staking model is shown as below, seven new APIs should be added to the java-tron client:
- `/wallet/freezebalancev2`
- `/wallet/unfreezebalancev2`
- `/wallet/delegateresource`
- `/wallet/undelegateresource`
- `/wallet/withdrawexpireunfreeze`
- `/wallet/getavailableunfreezecount`
- `/wallet/getcanwithdrawunfreezeamount`
- `/wallet/getcandelegatedmaxsize`
- `/wallet/getdelegatedresourcev2`
- `/wallet/getdelegatedresourceaccountindexv2`

and six new opcodes should be added to TVM:
`FREEZEBALANCEV2`, `UNFREEZEBALANCEV2`, `DELEGATERESOURCE`, `UNDELEGATERESOURCE`, `CANCELALLUNFREEZEV2`, `WITHDRAWEXPIREUNFREEZE `

## Mechanism
The mechanism of Stake 2.0 is shown as follows:

- User calls `/wallet/freezebalancev2` to stake TRX and obtain resources, specifing the type of resource. The corresponding resource goes to the owner address that has staked TRX.
- After staking and obtaining resources, the owner is able to call  `/wallet/delegateresource` to delegate resources to multiple recipients respectively. The delegating time locker is an optional, if selected, the delegated resources cannot be undelegated within 3 days, if not selected, there will not be lock-up period. When the owner repeat the delegating operation with time lock of same amount to the same receiver address, the lock-up period will be reset to 3 days.
- The owner call `/wallet/undelegateresource` to cancel the resource delegating for a recipient, supporting partial cancellation by amount.
- Call `/wallet/unfreezebalancev2` to unstake TRX, partial unstaking is supported, but only for the available part, TRX related to the delegated resources are considered locked and not available, therefore, cannot be unstaked.
- After the owner performs the unstaking operation, he needs to wait `N` days, then call `/wallet/withdrawexpireunfreeze` to get back TRX，`N` is a TRON network parameter.

### Specification in undelegateresource
If the recipient has consumed a part of the resource, after undelegating, this part of resources will still be not available status in the owner account, and needs some time to recover. The owner can only delegate the available resources to others.

Example：

- Assuming that A has 1000 units of energy, delegate all of them to B. After B used 400 units, A called `/wallet/undelegateresource` to undelegate all the energy left. Now, A has a balance of 600 units of energy in the account, 400 units are in recovering.

### Specification in unstake
TRX partial unstaking is supported, but a maximum of 32 partial unstaking operations is allowed simultaneously, in other words, there should be no more than 32 delay arrivals of the unstaking assets in progress at the same time.

Example,

- Assuming N is 3, and the user staked 50 TRX. On day 1, the user unstakes 1 TRX, he needs to wait for 3 days, that is, on day 4, the user will be able to get back 1 TRX. Then on day 2, the user unstakes another 1 TRX, he would be able to get it back on day 5. Each unstaking operation needs to wait for 3 days before redeeming.
  There could be at most 32 unstaking operations in processing at the same time in the new model.

Unstaking will first reclaim the idle TRON Power, then the TRON Power that has been used. For the reclaiming of TRON Power that has been used, if vote for multiple SRs, it will revoke votes in proportion.

Example：

- Suppose that a user stakes 2000 TRX and gets 2000 TRON Power, 1,000 TRON Power is idle and 1,000 TRON Power votes for 5 SRs. Each SR gets 200 votes. Now the user unstake 1500 TRX, which means 1500 TRON Power needs to be reclaimed, in this case, the 1000 idle TRON Power will be reclaimed first, then revoke 100 votes from each SR.

- Revoked votes from SR(A) = (Total revoked votes from all SRs/ Total previous votes to all SRs) * Total previous votes to SR(A)

# Backward Compatibility
After the proposal of the new mechanism is opened, it will not affect the previously frozen TRX. For those TRX frozen through the old mechanism, it can be redeemed using the old unstake interface. If needed, the only way to stake in the future is through the new mechanism.
