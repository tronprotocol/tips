## Simple Summary
A new **dual-word + 4-digit username system** designed to make TRON account transfers safer and easier while keeping decentralization principles.

## Abstract
This proposal introduces a human-readable username format based on **two meaningful English words followed by four digits** (e.g., `skyline2458`).  
This approach prevents copy-paste mistakes, enhances user confidence, and supports massive scalability (up to **3.6 quadrillion usernames**) using over 650,000 English words.

## Motivation
One of the biggest risks in blockchain transfers is **copy/paste error** or **address replacement by malware**.  
By linking TRON accounts to short, meaningful, and unique usernames, senders can visually confirm that they’re sending to the correct account — reducing human error and potential loss of funds.

## Specification

### Username Format
- Structure: **Two meaningful English words + four digits**  
- Examples: `bluebird1974`, `silvergate2048`  
- Case-insensitive (`SkyGate2048` = `skygate2048`)  
- Only ASCII letters and digits allowed  
- Each username must be unique across the TRON network

### Registration Rules
1. Usernames are optional; addresses still remain valid and functional.  
2. Registration can be handled on-chain (TRC smart contract) or derived deterministically from address (implementation choice).  
3. Ownership of a username is **linked to the owner’s wallet**.  
4. Usernames are **non-transferable**, preserving decentralization and privacy.

### System Features
- Prevents copy-paste mistakes and address spoofing.  
- 650,000 × 650,000 × 10,000 = **~3.6 quadrillion** possible combinations.  
- No need for centralized name management.  
- Lightweight implementation compatible with TRON’s current account structure.

## Rationale
This design ensures TRON remains **fully decentralized**, while helping users verify recipients easily and avoid copy/paste or malware address swaps.

## Implementation
- Minimal on-chain footprint: mapping or deterministic derivation.  
- Wallet developers should show both address and username in confirmation modal.  
- Optional: a small on-chain registry to lock username↔address mapping when needed.

## Security Considerations
- Use strict ASCII-only words and a vetted wordlist to avoid homograph attacks.  
- Confirmation modal must display both full address and username prior to signature.  
- For large transfers, require stronger confirmation (2FA or hardware wallet).
