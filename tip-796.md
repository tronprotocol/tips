### TIP-796 Proposal

**Title:**  
Dual-Word + 4-Digit Username System for TRON Accounts  

---

**Summary:**  
This PR proposes the introduction of a decentralized, human-readable username format for TRON accounts, consisting of two meaningful English words and a four-digit number.  

---

### Proposed Structure:  
- **Mode 1:** Two English words + 4-digit number (at the end)  
  - Example: `moonstar4821`  
- **Mode 2:** Two English words + 4-digit number (in the middle)  
  - Example: `star4821moon`  

> In future updates, a third mode — featuring a 4-digit number at the beginning followed by two English words — may be optionally added, with a minor adjustment to reduce visual similarity with the first mode, considering the right-to-left and left-to-right orientation of some languages, based on the TRON development team’s decision to further enhance name diversity.

### Key Points:  
- Structure: two meaningful English words and a 4-digit number (at the end or in the middle)  
- Case-insensitive (ASCII only)  
- Usernames are **non-transferable**, preserving decentralization  
- Wallets must display **both the username and the full destination address** in the signing confirmation modal  
- Enormous namespace: approximately **8.4 quadrillion possible combinations** using a large vetted wordlist  
- Goal: reduce **copy/paste errors** and prevent **address manipulation by malware**  
- Operates fully at the **Account Layer**, requiring **no smart contracts or protocol changes**  

---

### Capacity:  
With over **650,000 meaningful English words**, this design supports approximately **8.4 quadrillion unique usernames**, ensuring an exceptionally large and secure decentralized namespace.
