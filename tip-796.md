🧠 TIP-796 Proposal

**Title:**  
TRON Account-Layer Username Standard with "TR" Prefix (Uppercase)

---

**Summary:**  
This proposal introduces a decentralized, user-friendly username standard for TRON accounts implemented directly at the **Account Layer** —  
with **no need for smart contracts, Layer 2, gas, or fees**.  

Each username is **unique, permanent, and non-transferable**, designed to simplify account identification, prevent misdirected transfers caused by address manipulation or copy/paste errors, and maintain full compatibility with the existing TRON network structure.  

---

### Proposed Structure

All TRON usernames **must begin with the uppercase prefix `TR`**, followed by letters and digits arranged in one of the following three modes:  

**Mode 1**  
Prefix `TR` (uppercase), followed by two lowercase English words (a–z) and a four-digit number (0–9) at the end.  
Example: `TRsunboy1185`  

**Mode 2**  
Prefix `TR` (uppercase), followed by two lowercase English words (a–z) with a four-digit number (0–9) in the middle.  
Example: `TRsun7217boy`  

**Mode 3**  
Prefix `TR` (uppercase), followed by a four-digit number (0–9) and then two lowercase English words (a–z) at the end.  
Example: `TR7516sunboy`  

**Note:**  
No special characters, underscores, or spaces are allowed.  
The `TR` prefix clearly identifies the TRON network and, by being uppercase, ensures consistent recognition across multilingual and multi-directional text environments.  

---

### LTR Requirement (Left-to-Right)

All usernames **must be stored and displayed Left-to-Right (LTR)** and contain **only the allowed lowercase letters (a–z) and digits (0–9)** as defined above.  

This requirement maintains visual consistency and prevents spoofing or display errors in multilingual environments, especially in Right-to-Left (RTL) languages such as Persian or Arabic.  

---

### Key Points

- **Structure:** Uppercase `TR` prefix + two lowercase English words + four-digit number (in one of three modes).  
- **Non-transferable:** Ensures decentralization and identity integrity.  
- **Wallet Display:**  
  Wallets **must show both the full address and the complete username (including `TR`)** in the confirmation modal before signing.  
- **No auto-shortening:**  
  Wallets **must not omit or auto-hide** the `TR` prefix — usernames must be displayed exactly as transmitted by the network, respecting the LTR requirement.  

---

### Implementation Level

Usernames operate entirely at the **Account Layer**,  
requiring **no smart contracts, gas, fees, or Layer 2 integration**,  
and have **no impact on network validation protocols**.  

---

### Capacity and Namespace

Using over **650,000 meaningful English words**, this design supports approximately **12.6 quadrillion unique combinations**, providing a vast and sustainable namespace for TRON’s future ecosystem.  

---

### Objective

To create a **native, decentralized, and reliable username system** at the **Account Layer**,  
without depending on off-chain naming services, Layer 2 systems, or any gas or fee consumption.  

This standard enhances user experience, strengthens protection against address spoofing, and ensures accurate fund delivery.  

---

### Future Extensions

Potential updates may include:  
- New username format modes,  
- Extended character sets,  
- Or special identifiers for MemeCoins, NFTs, and other on-chain categories —  
based on TRON Core Dev Team’s discretion for broader flexibility and usability.
