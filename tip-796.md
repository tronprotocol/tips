📘 Summary
TIP-796 introduces a native, unique, non-transferable username standard for TRON accounts, implemented directly at the Account Layer.
This system:
requires no smart contracts
charges zero gas/fees
enhances security, usability, and human readability
neutralizes dozens of address-based attack vectors
remains fully compatible with TRON’s existing architecture
Its goal is to create a trustworthy, human-readable identity layer that eliminates address confusion, phishing, and UI-level manipulation.
🧩 Username Structure
All TRON usernames must begin with uppercase TR and follow one of three valid patterns using lowercase ASCII letters (a–z) and digits (0–9).
Mode 1
TR + two English words + four-digit number
Example: TRsunboy1185
Mode 2
TR + first word + four-digit number + second word
Example: TRsun7217boy
Mode 3
TR + four-digit number + two English words
Example: TR7516sunboy
Rules:
No special characters, spaces, or underscores
100% ASCII
100% LTR storage and rendering
Uppercase TR prefix is mandatory and part of the username identity
🔠 LTR Enforcement & Visual Anti-Spoofing
Usernames must always be stored and displayed Left-to-Right (LTR).
This eliminates:
Homograph attacks
RTL/LTR direction-switch attacks
Font-based spoofing
Display manipulation in Persian/Arabic/Hebrew UI environments
⚙️ Core Rules
The TR prefix is mandatory and stored on-chain exactly as is.
Wallets must display the full username (including TR) and the full address before signing any transaction.
Wallets may not shorten or hide any part of the username.
The system operates entirely at the Account Layer, with zero cost and no protocol burden.
🔥 Full Elimination of All Known Address-Based Attacks
(Highest Security Level Achievable in Blockchain Username Systems)
TIP-796 neutralizes every major attack vector involving addresses, including:
1. Clipboard Hijacking
Malware replacing clipboard addresses →
Mismatch with destination username immediately exposes the attack.
2. Address Spoofing / Look-Alike Generation
Attackers generate thousands of similar addresses →
Username is non-spoofable and breaks the attack.
3. Homograph Attacks
Swapping characters like "0" with "٠" →
Disallowed entirely by ASCII-only enforcement.
4. RTL/LTR Direction Attacks
Manipulating direction to flip parts of the address →
LTR-only rendering disables this attack type completely.
5. UI-Layer Manipulation Attacks
Fake wallets hiding or visually slicing an address →
Mandatory full username display prevents deception.
6. Social Engineering on Non-Technical Users
Human-readable usernames + enforced visibility →
Human error nearly eliminated.
7. Spam-Activation & Transaction Injection Attacks
Spammers send micro-transactions to appear in “recent activity” →
A consistent, unfakeable username breaks this deception model.
🔥 Username Assignment — Anti-Bot & Anti-Abuse Mechanisms
To prevent large-scale automated account creation or username farming:
1. Time-Delay Assignment (Cooldown Window)
A username is assigned only after a configurable delay following account activation.
Default: 24 hours
Nodes may increase to 48 hours or more for stricter anti-abuse.
2. Minimum Balance Requirement
A username is assigned only if the account maintains a minimum balance during the cooldown.
Suggested default: 2 TRX (or equivalent frozen balance)
Can be increased to 10 TRX for stronger protection.
3. Mandatory Wallet Onboarding Before Display
Before showing the username, the wallet must display a multilingual onboarding panel explaining:
what the username is
how it is generated
how it is bound to the account
how it protects the user
where it is displayed
how to use it safely
User must scroll and explicitly confirm.
4. Optional Anti-Bot Challenge (Local CAPTCHA / PoW)
Wallets may require a lightweight challenge.
Network only verifies the result; execution remains wallet-side.
Combined effect:
Bots must:
wait 24–48 hours
hold real TRX
complete onboarding
solve CAPTCHAs
repeat this for every account
➡️ Economically impossible
➡️ Fully kills username-mining bots
📊 Namespace Capacity
With over 650,000 English words, the system supports:
12.6 quadrillion unique usernames
🎯 Purpose
To provide TRON with a native, decentralized, visually safe, and non-spoofable identity layer —
eliminating human-layer vulnerabilities without gas, fees, or smart contracts.
🔮 Future Extensions
Additional structural modes
Expanded character sets
Special categories for NFTs, MemeCoins, or ecosystem tags
