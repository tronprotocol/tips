## Simple Summary

This TIP is optimize leveldb read performance.

## Abstract
Through analysis,[parameters that affect performance](https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/master/include/leveldb/options.h#L72)
read performance is affected `by write_buffer_size`, `max_open_files`, `block_cache` etc.
We analyze existing databases and classify them according to read frequency, and set appropriate parameters for different type.



## Specification

### write_buffer_size

Amount of data to build up in memory,Larger values increase R/W performance.

### max_open_files

Number of open files that can be used by the DB,increase this ,increase read performance.

> Attention: to increase this ,you may increase `ulimit` first. 

### block_cache

Cache for blocks,increase this, increase read performance.

## Motivation
Improve  levelDB performance by tuning db parameter `max_open_files`.


## Implementation

We have divided the existing database into three groups.

- 1. Group A
        > The vast majority of databases,with very little data, with low read frequency.
- 2. Group B
        > `contract` and  `code` db, with little data, with normal read frequency.
- 3. Group C
        > `delegation`  `account` and `storage-row` db, with large data, read frequently.

The following settings are based on `8c`,`16g`,`1t hdd`, `ulimit 65535`


Online ,`max_open_files` is set to `100`  for all dbs. 
The java-tron process holds database `sst` file around 1000 for now.

### max_open_files

- 1. read lowly
        > max_open_files = 100 for Group A
- 2. read normally
        > max_open_files = 500 for Group B
- 3. read frequently  
        > max_open_files = 1000 for Group C
     

### how to set 

add `default` for base settings ,`defaultM` for Group B, `defaultL` for Group C into storage.

for example

```
storage {
    # Directory for storing persistent data
    db.version = 2,
    db.engine = "LEVELDB",
    db.directory = "database",
    index.directory = "index",

    # This configuration item is only for SolidityNode.
    # Turn off the index is "off", else "on".
    # Turning off the index will significantly improve the performance of the SolidityNode sync block.
    # You can turn off the index if you don't use the two interfaces getTransactionsToThis and getTransactionsFromThis.
    index.switch = "off"

    # This configuration item is used to database write strategy.
    # Synchronous writing is "true", else Asynchronous writing is "false".
    # Asynchronous writing significantly improves the performance of the FullNode sync block.
    # 1. If asynchronous, the write will be flushed from the operating system buffer cache.
    #    the machine crashes, some recent writes may be lost. Note that if it is just the process that
    #    crashes (i.e., the machine does not reboot), no writes will be lost;
    # 2. If synchronous, writes will be flush into leveldb directly.
    #     No writes will be lost when machine crashes, but it is slow.
    db.sync = false,

    # This configuration item controls the transaction result be put into transactionHistory database.
    # Turn off the switch is "off", else "on".
    # Turning off the switch, transaction result will not be put into transactionHistory database;
    # You can turn off the switch if you don't use the interface getransactioninfobyid.
    transHistory.switch = "on",
    ########### add new start ##########
    # custom default configs
    default = {
        maxOpenFiles = 100
    }
    # custom default  for read a lot configs ,"code", "contract"
    defaultM = {
        maxOpenFiles = 500
    }
    # custom default for  Read frequently configs,"account", "delegation","storage-row"
    defaultL = {
    maxOpenFiles = 1000
    }
   ########### add new end ##########
    # You can custom these 14 databases' configs:
    properties = [
    # END ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK
//    {
//      name = "account",
//      path = "storage_directory_test",
//      createIfMissing = true,
//      paranoidChecks = true,
//      verifyChecksums = true,
    //      compressionType = 1,        // compressed with snappy
    //      blockSize = 4096,           // 4  KB =         4 * 1024 B
    //      writeBufferSize = 10485760, // 10 MB = 10 * 1024 * 1024 B
    //      cacheSize = 10485760,       // 10 MB = 10 * 1024 * 1024 B
    //      maxOpenFiles = 100
    //    },
//    {
//      name = "account-index",
//      path = "storage_directory_test",
//      createIfMissing = true,
//      paranoidChecks = true,
//      verifyChecksums = true,
    //      compressionType = 1,        // compressed with snappy
    //      blockSize = 4096,           // 4  KB =         4 * 1024 B
    //      writeBufferSize = 10485760, // 10 MB = 10 * 1024 * 1024 B
    //      cacheSize = 10485760,       // 10 MB = 10 * 1024 * 1024 B
    //      maxOpenFiles = 100
    //    },
    ]

    }          
```

###Performance Testing:

block count: 35880.

default.maxOpenFiles:100,
defaultM.maxOpenFiles:500,
defaultL.maxOpenFiles:1000.

We use [arthas](https://arthas.aliyun.com/doc/) to monitor leveldb read performance


| Strategy      | dbRead(ms) | pushBlockAvg(ms) | sst files |  mem(%)   |
| :---          |   :---:    |    :----:        |   :----:  |  :----:   |
| base          |   0.05     |    201.03        |   1000    |  71.3     | 
| optimize      |   0.12     |    164.47        |   4100    |  72.1     | 

Before optimization average cost: 201.03 ms, After optimization average cost: 164.47 ms
Performance improvement: (201.03 - 164.47) / 201.03 = 18.18%.

Finally, you can increase or decrease `maxOpenFiles` depending on your situation.


## Rationale
`max_open_files` is unsuitable for some dbs.
