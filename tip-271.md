## Simple Summary

To provide vote related operations in TVM.

## Abstract

VoteWitness & WithdrawReward operations in system contract are introduced, smart contract can vote for witness and get reward from the system.

## Motivation

Common user can vote for activated witness to share the block reward. However, non-privatekey accounts, like smart contracts, can not get benefit from this incentive mechanism. 

Meanwhile, after [EIP-157](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/blob/master/tip-157.md) activating on the mainnet, smart contracts can freeze their balance to get resources include tron power. But this part of resources can not be used because there is no vote related instructions in TVM.

So this TIP aims to implement the incentive voting functionalities for smart contracts. On one hand, smart contracts will take fully advantage of their balance. For example, voting witness, keeping the network safe, sharing the block reward. On the other hand, developer could write some special voting contracts to provide a new way to vote witness for common user which is different from system voting contract. These voting contracts may be more complex to system voting contract and provide more attractive and unique voting feature.

## Specifications

### New instructions

#### `0xd8`: `VOTEWITNESS`

The `VOTE` takes 4 operands pop up from stack:

`tronPowerArrayLength`: witness address array offset.

`tronPowerArrayOffset`: witness address array size.

`witnessAddressArrayLength`: tron power number array offset.

`witnessAddressArrayOffset`: tron power number array size.

TVM will get witness array from memory by using `witnessOffset` and `witnessSize`.

TVM will get tron power array from memory by using `tronPowerOffset` and `tronPowerSize`.

Execute vote function and push 0 to stack if fail, push 1 otherwize.

#### `0xd9`: `WITHDRAWREWARD`

The `WITHDRAWREWARD` takes no operand pop up from stack.

Execute withdraw function and push 0 to stack if fail, push 1 otherwise.

### New precompile contracts

#### `0x1000005`: `RewardBalance`

The `RewardBalance` takes no operand pop up from stack.

Execute query reward function and push reward balance to stack.

#### `0x1000006`: `IsSrCandidate`

The `IsSrCandidate` takes 1 operand pop up from stack:

`targetAddress`: target account address.

Push 0 if target address is not a witness, otherwise push 1.

#### `0x1000007`: `VoteCount`

The `VoteCount` takes 2 operand pop up from stack:

`voteAddress`: vote account address.

`targetAddress`: target account address.

Execute query vote count function and push vote count to stack.

#### `0x1000008`: `TotalVoteCount`

The `TotalVoteCount` takes 1 operand pop up from stack:

`voteAddress`: vote account address.

Execute query total vote count function.

#### `0x1000009`: `TotalReceivedVoteCount`

The `TotalReceviedVoteCount` takes 1 operand pop up from stack:

`receivedAddress`: witness address.

Excute query witness total received vote count.


### Solidity Example

```solidity
contract TestVote {

    function voteWitness(address[] memory witnessList, uint[] memory tpList) public returns(bool) {
        return vote(witnessList, tpList);
    }
    
    function withdrawReward() external returns(uint) {
        return withdrawreward();
    }
    
    function queryReward() external view returns(uint) {
        return rewardBalance();
    }
    
    function isWitness(address srAddress) external view returns(uint) {
        return isSrCandidate(srAddress);
    }
    
    function queryVoteCount(address from, address to) external view returns(uint) {
        return voteCount(from, to);
    }
    
    function queryTotalVoteCount(address voter) external view returns(uint) {
        return totalVoteCount(voter);
    }
    
    function queryTotalReceivedVoteCount(address srAddress) external view returns(uint) {
        return totalReceviedVoteCount(srAddress);
    }
    
}
```

#### Notice

For `vote(address[] memory, uint[] memory)`, if array length in memory does not match the parameter length, a `ByteExecutionException` throws and this will casue TVM halt.

For `withdrawreward()`, withdraw all rewards to contract balance.

### New reward calculation algorithm

#### For witness

- While doing maintenance, update $v_i$ for every witness according to total rewards and total votes of witness, which $i$ is cycle number, then we have the following formula:
  $$
  v_i = v_{i-1}+reward_i{\div}vote_i
  $$

#### For user

- Before voting new witness, user must withdraw reward.

- Create a new proposal to activate new reward calculation algorithm, we define $k$ which is the proposal`s effective cycle.

- The new reward calculation algorithm contain several steps:

  - If $cycle_{begin} < k$, calculate these old rewards between $cycle_{begin}$ and $k$ by old reward algorithm

  - Otherwise, calculate new rewards over cycles $i \cdots j(j>i)$, use the following formula:
    $$
    Reward=\sum_{w=w_1}^{w_n}(v_{j-1,w}-v_{i,w})\times vote_w
    $$
    $w_1 \cdots w_n$ means witness list which user would vote, $v_{i,w}$ means $v_i$ for $witness_w$, $vote_w$ means user`s vote count for $witness_w$

  - Total rewards include old rewards and new rewards

## Rationale

### Tier

`VOTEWITNESS`: tier.ExtTier

`WITHDRAWREWARD`: tier.ExtTier

### Energy cost

#### Instructions

`VOTEWITNESS`: 30000 energy

`WITHDRAWREWARD`: 20000 energy

#### Precomplie contracts

`RewardBalance`: 500 energy

`IsSrCandidate`: 20 energy

`VoteCount`: 500 energy

`TotalVoteCount`: 20 energy

`TotalReceivedVoteCount`: 20 energy


### Selfdestruct

If contract still has reward balance which is not withdrawed, selfdestruct will withdraw reward to balance, then revoke its all votes.
