## Simple Summary
Monitor your Java-tron server with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and  [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/).

## Abstract
Use `prometheus`, we can monitor node status, block information, transactions, api calls, method calls, mining block status, etc, then use `grafana` to show infos, make alerts, and be able to better maintain node running.

## Motivation
Currently, the popular blockchain basically supports open-source monitoring [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), java-tron has its own [monitoring api](http://52.15.93.92:8090/monitor/getstatsinfo), but it is not compatible with `prometheus`.If you want to use the current monitoring, you need to build your own front-end visualization. It is very unfriendly for users to monitor their own nodes.

## Specification


### 1.  What Is Prometheus?
[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit .Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

### 2. What Are Metrics?
In layperson terms, metrics are numeric measurements, time series mean that changes are recorded over time. What users want to measure differs from application to application. For a web server it might be request times, for a database it might be number of active connections or number of active queries etc.

Metrics play an important role in understanding why your application is working in a certain way. Let's assume you are running a web application and find that the application is slow. You will need some information to find out what is happening with your application. For example the application can become slow when the number of requests are high. If you have the request count metric you can spot the reason and increase the number of servers to handle the load.

### 3. How To Use?
Expose the `mertic API` using [simpleclient](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.prometheus/simpleclient) and [simpleclient_httpserver](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.prometheus/simpleclient_httpserver).  Please visit [client_java#readme](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java#readme) for more details.

### 4. How To Enable?
Add two new settings to the config.conf file as follows.
```
net {
  type = mainnet
  # type = testnet
}
... ...
node {
  ... ...
  p2p {
    version = 11111 # 11111: mainnet; 20180622: testnet
  }
  ####### add for prometheus start.
 metrics{
  prometheus{
  enable=true 
  port="9527"
  }
}
####### add for prometheus end.
}
```

### 6. Metrics API
We provide the standard prometheus http API, please visit [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for more detail.


## Rationale

Using open source monitoring  [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and data  dashboards [grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/),monitor  and expose metrics with prometheus, use `simpleclient `to record metrics, `simpleclient_httpserver` to expose api. Query, visualize, alert on, and understand metrics with  [grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/).


## Implementation
