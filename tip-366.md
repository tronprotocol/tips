## Abstract
Currently, it takes about 1 minute from node starts  to  block synchronization. Block synchronization depends on node tcp establishment.During the start-up，the current tcp connection establishment thread is delayed by 30s to wait neighbors discovery. However, when `node.discovery.persist = true`, the current discovered node will be stored persistently at regular intervals.

## Specification

Change TCP initialDelay  from 30s to 100ms, TCP connection using last persistent node information instead of waiting for `30s`.

## Motivation
Speed up TCP establishment for the purpose of fast node startup.

## Implementation

### SyncPool
```java

public void init() {
        //......
        poolLoopExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(() -> {
        try {
        //.... node discovery
        } catch (Throwable t) {
        logger.error("Exception in sync worker", t);
        }
        }, 100, 3600, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
        
        }        
```


## Rationale
TCP initialDelay take up  much time(30s) during node start up（about 1min）.
