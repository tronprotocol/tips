## Simple Summary

To provide vote related operations in TVM.

## Abstract

Vote & withdrawReward operation in system contract are introduced, smart contract can vote for witness and get reward from the system.

## Motivation

Common user can vote for activated witness to get block reward. However, none privatekey accounts, like smart contracts, can't get benefit from this incentive mechanism.  This TIP provide instructions to implement the incentive functionalities.

## Specification

The following instructions are introduced:

### `0xd9`: `VOTE`

The `VOTE` takes 4 operands pop up from stack:

`witnessOffset`: witness information offset.

`witnessSize`: witness information size.

`tronPowerOffset`: tron power information.

`tronPowerSize`: tron power information array size.

TVM will get sr array from memory by using `witnessOffset` and `witnessSize`.

TVM will get tron power nubmer array from memory by using `tronPowerOffset` and `tronPowerSize`.

Execute vote function and push 0 to stack if fail, push 1 otherwize.

### `0xda`: `WITHDRAWREWARD`

The `WITHDRAWREWARD` takes 1 operand from stack.

`accountAddress`: target account address.

Execute withdraw function and push 0 to stack if fail, push 1 otherwise.

### `0xdc`: `ISWITNESS`

The `ISWITNESS` takes 1 operand from stack.

`accountAddress`: target account address.

Push 0 if target address is not a witness, otherwise push 1.

### Result show in SystemLog

SystemLog is contains system level operation result in transactioninfo for a specific transaction.

A system log structure can be defined as below:

```
message SystemLog {
  enum operationType {
    VOTE = 1;
    WITHDRAWREWARD = 2;
  }
  bytes address = 1; // user address or contract address
  repeated bytes params = 2;
  // VOTE contains 2 parameters: VOTE(toAddress, TRONPowerValue);
  // WITHDRAWREWARD contains 1 parameter: WITHDRAWREWARD(toAddress);
  
  operationType type = 3;
}
```

Vote and withdraw infomation will be record in the SystemLog field in transactionInfo.

## Rationale

`VOTE` tier.ExtTier

`WITHDRAWREWARD` tier.ExtTier

`REWARDBALANCE` tier.ExtTier

`ISWITNESS` tier.ExtTier
