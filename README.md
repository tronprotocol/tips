# 🧠 TIP-796 – Account Layer Username Standard

**Title:** Account Layer Username Standard  
**Authors:** Ali & ChatGPT  
**Status:** Draft  
**Type:** Standards Track  

---

## 📘 Abstract

This proposal introduces a standardized username format directly at the **account layer**, eliminating the need for secondary layers, smart contracts, or gas/fee mechanisms.  

---

## 🧩 Username Format

The standard username structure consists of two main formats:

- **Pattern 1:** Two English words followed by a four-digit number (e.g., `sunbird2048`)  
- **Pattern 2:** Two English words with a four-digit number placed in the middle (e.g., `sun2048bird`)  

In future updates, **Pattern 3**, which includes **two English words and a four-digit number at the beginning**, may be added to increase format diversity.  

The addition of Pattern 3 will consider language direction (right-to-left and left-to-right) and prevent excessive similarity with Pattern 1 **by introducing a minor variation as determined by the development team**.

## 💡 Purpose

To create a **native username system** within the **TRON blockchain network**, allowing each account to have a **readable, unique, and permanent** name — without modifying transaction validation or relying on external layers.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Benefits

- No gas or fee required for username creation  
- Fully integrated at the account layer  
- No smart contracts required  
- Maintains full decentralization and backward compatibility
