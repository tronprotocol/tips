## Simple Summary

This TIP describes why and how we supplement disconnect reasons in java-tron.

## Abstract

We supplement two disconnect reasons in java-tron, including NOT\_WITNESS used inRelayService and NO\_SUCH\_MESSAGE in P2pEventHandlerImpl, so other peers can acquire the reason why we disconnect with it better.

## Motivation

Java-tron nodes send DisconnectMessage to peers before stopping the connection. When stopping, the nodes use relatedReasonCode if it exists as DisconnectMessage, otherwise, no message would be sent. Most java-tron logs record the ReasonCode of peer disconnection, but some do not. For example, the reason for disconnection with non-witness nodes in RelayService is not given.

## Specification

### Unused ReasonCode

We summarize the use of ReasonCode, many of which have been abandoned and some are moved to libp2p, they may get deleted in the future:
```
    enum ReasonCode {
      REQUESTED = 0x00;             //Not used
      BAD_PROTOCOL = 0x02;         
      TOO_MANY_PEERS = 0x04;        //Not used
      DUPLICATE_PEER = 0x05;       
      INCOMPATIBLE_PROTOCOL = 0x06; //Not used
      RANDOM_ELIMINATION = 0x07;    //Not used
      PEER_QUITING = 0x08;          
      UNEXPECTED_IDENTITY = 0x09;   
      LOCAL_IDENTITY = 0x0A;        //Not used
      PING_TIMEOUT = 0x0B;          //Not used
      USER_REASON = 0x10;           //Not used
      RESET = 0x11;                 //Not used
      SYNC_FAIL = 0x12;
      FETCH_FAIL = 0x13;
      BAD_TX = 0x14;
      BAD_BLOCK = 0x15;
      FORKED = 0x16;
      UNLINKABLE = 0x17;
      INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION = 0x18;
      INCOMPATIBLE_CHAIN = 0x19;
      TIME_OUT = 0x20;
      CONNECT_FAIL = 0x21;                //Not used
      TOO_MANY_PEERS_WITH_SAME_IP = 0x22; //Not used
      LIGHT_NODE_SYNC_FAIL = 0x23;   
      BELOW_THAN_ME = 0X24;
      UNKNOWN = 0xFF;
    }

    message DisconnectMessage {
      ReasonCode reason = 1;
    }
```
### Add new types to Java-tron ReasonCode

Add the following enumeration type to protos/core/Tron.proto

    enum ReasonCode {
      REQUESTED = 0x00;         
      ...
      NOT_WITNESS = 0x25; //Added
      NO_SUCH_MESSAGE = 0x26; //Added
      ...
      UNKNOWN = 0xFF;
    }

So, we can use this ReasonCode here, such as in RelayService.java :

### Send ReasonCode to peer before node quits

Any node should notify peers of the reason when it quits, so others can understand the network better:
```
public static void close() {
  ...
    for (PeerConnection p : new ArrayList<>(peers)) {
      if (!p.isDisconnect()) {
        p.disconnect(ReasonCode.PEER_QUITING); //added
        p.getChannel().close();
      }
    }
  ...
}
```
## Compatibility

All of the newly added unrecognized ReasonCode will be converted to UNKNOWN, and no exception will be thrown.
