## Simple Summary

An adaptation to solidity-v0.5.15

## Abstract

Ethereum released version 0.5.15 of solidity to fix a bug. Solidity in tron should be updated to follow this release.

## Motivation

The release of solidity-v0.5.15 means this bugfix about Yul Optimizer is very necessary. We should update solidity to follow this release as soon as possible.

## Specification

The previous release of solidity introduced an incorrect redundant load optimization crossing user-defined functions that contain for-loops with memory / storage writes. This bug may cause wrong results even failure of function calls. The release of solidity-v0.5.15 fixed this bug quickly. So we should update solidity in Tron to follow this release.
