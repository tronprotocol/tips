## Simple Summary

To provide CHAINID instruction in TVM.

## Abstract

This is value can be read from smart contract to distinguish current chain with other chains.

## Motivation

Currently we have multiple chains in TRON ecosystem those are build from 3 main ways: testnets, side-chain and cross-chains.From smart contract perspective, currently we don't have a mechnism to distinguish those chains, which leads to potential replay attacks. As a result, a chainid parameter is required in TVM level to guanrantee smart contract safety.

## Specification

### `0x46`: `CHAINID`

`CHAINID` takes 0 operands pop up from stack.

The return value is the genesis block id for this chain as uint256.

## Rationale

### `CHAINID` tier.ExtTier
