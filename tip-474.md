## Abstract

This TIP aims to optimize the return value of the `chainid` opcode.

## Motivation

The chainId of the TRON mainnet can be queried through the `jsonrpc` interface, as follows
```shell=
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.trongrid.io/jsonrpc' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "eth_chainId", "params": [], "id": 1}'

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x2b6653dc"}
```

After the `Istanbul` proposal takes effect, the `chainid` opcode becomes valid and it pushes the genesis block id of the current chain onto the stack (defined in [tip-174](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/blob/master/tip-174.md)).

In different networks, the return values of the `chainid` opcode are as follows:

- `mainnet`: 0x00000000000000001ebf88508a03865c71d452e25f4d51194196a1d22b6653dc
- `nile`: 0x0000000000000000d698d4192c56cb6be724a558448e2684802de4d6cd8690dc
- `shasta`: 0x0000000000000000de1aa88295e1fcf982742f773e0419c5a9c134c994a9059e

The return value of the `chainid` opcode does not match the chainId value queried by the `jsonrpc` interface. When dApp developers use tools such as metamask to access the TRON network and send transactions, this difference will cause some transactions to fail, such as permit type transactions.

Meanwhile, the return value of the `chainid` opcode is very large. For the javascript language that commonly used in web3 application development, the maximum integer value is `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`(defined in [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)), and it is clear that the above return values exceed that `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.

- `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`: 2**53 - 1 = 9007199254740991

Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the return value of the `chainid` opcode in the TRON network.

## Specification

After the `getAllowOptimizedReturnValueOfChainId(71th)` proposal takes effect, the `chainid` opcode pushes the same value as the `jsonrpc` interface onto the stack.

The new return value of the `chainid` opcode for all networks are as follows:

- `mainnet`:
  - In Hex: 0x2b6653dc
  - In Decimal: 728126428
- `nile`:
  - In Hex: 0xcd8690dc
  - In Decimal: 3448148188
- `shasta`:
  - In Hex: 0x94a9059e
  - In Decimal: 2494104990

## Rationale

The new values above do not conflict with any chainId of the existing EVM networks.

## Backwards Compatibility

Firstly, the new return values proposed in this tip are consistent with some of the TRON community's protocol standards, such as [tip-1193](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/issues/466) and [tip-712](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/issues/443).

Secondly, after analyzing the bytecode of the smart contracts on the mainnet and extensive community discussions, we concluded that the proposal has no significant forward compatibility issues. See [issue](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/issues/474) for related analysis and discussion.

## Security Considerations

There is no known security consideration.
