# Simple Summary
This TIP aims to optimize the account index storage structure of resource delegating, to improve transaction execution performance and throughput.
# Abstract
During the execution of the existing delegating transaction, when an owner delegates resources to others, it is necessary to maintain the delegate relationship between each other and store it persistently. The read performance of the delegate relationship will drop sharply when the delegate relationship of a single owner increases, and even seriously affect the execution efficiency of the transactions. This paper introduces the optimization of the delegate relationship storage data structure in detail.
# Motivation
According to the latest pressure test, the increment of the delegate relationship to a single account will linearly increase the transaction execution time as below,

| Number of account relationships  | Avg. execution time (ms) |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1                                | 5                        |
| 20000                            | 74                       |
| 180000                           | 620                      |

By applying an optimized storage structure, the transaction execution time almost remains with the account relationship increasing.

| Number of account relationships  | Avg. execution time (ms) |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1                                | 5                        |
| 20000                            | 6                        |
| 180000                           | 8                        |

To improve the network performance, and cut down the transaction execution time, the optimized storage structure utilized above should be implemented.
# Rationale
The current delegate account relationship structure is as below,
```
message DelegatedResourceAccountIndex {
  bytes account = 1;
  repeated bytes fromAccounts = 2;
  repeated bytes toAccounts = 3;
}
```
`account` is defined as the subject account.
`fromAccounts` is the list of the addresses that have delegated resources to the subject account.
`toAccounts` is the list of the recipient addresses that the subject address has delegated its resources to.
When storing the delegate account relationship, the subject account address is used as the key, and the structure is stored as the value. When maintaining a new delegate relationship, it is necessary to read the fromAccounts or toAccounts of the subject account to determine whether the new delegate relationship is in these lists. If there is, just Ignore it, otherwise, add it to the list accordingly. This reading method will drastically reduce the system performance when the list data is expanded.

To cope with that, the storage is optimized for fromAccounts and toAccounts, with the key-value paradigm applied. Please check the following,
```
public void delegate(byte[] from, byte[] to, long time) {
    byte[] fromKey = createKey(fromPrefix, from, to);
    DelegatedResourceAccountIndexCapsule toIndexCapsule =
        new DelegatedResourceAccountIndexCapsule(ByteString.copyFrom(to));
    toIndexCapsule.setTimestamp(time);
    this.put(fromKey, toIndexCapsule);

    byte[] toKey = createKey(toPrefix, to, from);
    DelegatedResourceAccountIndexCapsule fromIndexCapsule =
        new DelegatedResourceAccountIndexCapsule(ByteString.copyFrom(from));
    fromIndexCapsule.setTimestamp(time);
    this.put(toKey, fromIndexCapsule);
  }

private byte[] createKey(byte[] prefix, byte[] address1, byte[] address2) {
    byte[] key = new byte[prefix.length + address1.length + address2.length];
    System.arraycopy(prefix, 0, key, 0, prefix.length);
    System.arraycopy(address1, 0, key, prefix.length, address1.length);
    System.arraycopy(address2, 0, key, prefix.length + address1.length, address2.length);
    return key;
  }
```
In the new method, by adding `fromPrefix` to the addresses in `toAccounts`, we correlate them with the subject account together as `fromKey` and pack `toAccounts` to `new DelegatedResourceAccountIndexCapsule(ByteString.copyFrom(to)) `as value and then store them.

`toPrefixis` added to the addresses in `fromAccounts`, and correlate them with the subject account as `toKey`, and pack `fromAccounts` to `DelegatedResourceAccountIndexCapsule(ByteString.copyFrom(from)) `as value, then store them.

After the proposal is activated, when the first delegating is made, all the addresses in `fromAccounts` and `toAccounts` will migrate and be stored in the new data structure,
```
public void convert(byte[] address) {
    DelegatedResourceAccountIndexCapsule indexCapsule = this.get(address);
    if (indexCapsule == null) {
      // convert complete or have no delegate
      return;
    }
    // convert old data
    List<ByteString> toList = indexCapsule.getToAccountsList();
    for (int i = 0; i < toList.size(); i++) {
      // use index as the timestamp, just to keep index in order
      this.delegate(address, toList.get(i).toByteArray(), i + 1L);
    }

    List<ByteString> fromList = indexCapsule.getFromAccountsList();
    for (int i = 0; i < fromList.size(); i++) {
      // use index as the timestamp, just to keep index in order
      this.delegate(fromList.get(i).toByteArray(), address, i + 1L);
    }
    this.delete(address);
  }
```
All delegating afterward will be stored through the new structure.
